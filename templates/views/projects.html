                    Project Poop creates a way for people to accomplish things
                    step by step. It gives a unqiue UI/UX for organizing tasks and goals
                    based on the task and goal. This application is utilizing technologies
                    such as Django, Vue, Docker, and Nginx. This application is still under production.
                    More information about the relese of this application will come soon.
