                            System Maintemence, Business Stategy, and much more.
                            This project only contains the blueprints of a full scale LMS for high schools.

                            Project Rock creates a way for people to accomplish things
                            step by step. It gives a unqiue UI/UX for organizing tasks and goals
                            based on the task and goal. This application is still under production.
                            More information about the relese of this application will come soon.
