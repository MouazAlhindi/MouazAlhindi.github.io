                                This project is the product of the CSCI 205 Final project at Bucknell University.
                                My team and I built a game using Libgdx and JAVA. We used Scrum along the way to
                                manage the project and oversee progress. The game is a tycoon based game around farming
                                crops and making money off of harvesting the crops, while having to manage time and pay rent.

                                This project is a final project in conjunction with CSCI 208 and CSCI 363 at Bucknell University.
                                Rubo is an Open Source API Framework built with Ruby. Ruby provides programming tools to create the following: 
                                Server, Database Tables, and API endpoints. Even though both CSCI 208 and 363 came to an ending, I leave this project
                                open to the public for contribution.
